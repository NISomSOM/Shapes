        <h2>Welcome to Shapes in Nature</h2>
        <p>Nature is a masterful artist, creating mesmerizing patterns and forms that follow mathematical principles. From the hexagons of honeycombs to the spirals of galaxies, geometry is everywhere in the natural world. Explore these stunning shapes and discover their beauty and significance.</p>

        <h2>Hexagons</h2>
        <p>Hexagons are a common shape in nature, known for their efficiency and strength. Honeycombs in beehives are perfect examples, where hexagonal cells provide maximum storage with minimal material. You can also find hexagons in crystals and basalt rock formations.</p>

        <h2>Spirals</h2>
        <p>Spirals are mesmerizing patterns that appear in shells, hurricanes, and galaxies. The Fibonacci spiral, which follows the Fibonacci sequence, is a common mathematical pattern found in sunflower seeds, pinecones, and nautilus shells.</p>

        <h2>Symmetry</h2>
        <p>Symmetry is a hallmark of natural beauty. Flowers, butterflies, and snowflakes exhibit radial and bilateral symmetry, creating balance and harmony. Symmetry is not just aestheticâ€”it often serves functional purposes in nature.</p>

        <h2>Fractals</h2>
        <p>Fractals are intricate patterns that repeat at different scales. They are found in snowflakes, lightning bolts, river systems, and even tree branches. These self-similar patterns demonstrate the infinite complexity of nature.</p>

        <h2>Tessellations</h2>
        <p>Tessellations are repeating patterns of shapes that fit together without gaps or overlaps. In nature, tessellations can be seen in the scales of fish, the arrangement of leaves, and the patterns on animal skins.</p>

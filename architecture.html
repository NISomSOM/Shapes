                <h2>The Role of Geometry in Architecture</h2>
                <p>Architecture is a perfect blend of art and science, and geometry forms its backbone. From ancient wonders to modern skyscrapers, geometric shapes are used to achieve stability, efficiency, and aesthetic brilliance. Each structure is a story told through angles, curves, and proportions.</p>

                <h2>Iconic Examples of Geometric Architecture</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pyramids of Giza (Egypt):</strong> A timeless triangular masterpiece that showcases the power of symmetry and alignment.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Taj Mahal (India):</strong> The perfect use of symmetry, circles, and patterns to symbolize eternal beauty and love.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Louvre Pyramid (France):</strong> A modern geometric marvel combining glass and triangular precision.</li>
                    <li><strong>Burj Khalifa (UAE):</strong> A towering feat that integrates triangular and hexagonal designs for strength and elegance.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>How Shapes Influence Modern Design</h2>
                <p>Today, architects use advanced tools like CAD (Computer-Aided Design) to experiment with geometric shapes. Parametric design allows for the creation of unique forms, such as undulating facades, honeycomb structures, and organic curves inspired by nature.</p>
                <p>Beyond beauty, geometry helps optimize space, improve energy efficiency, and create resilient buildings that withstand environmental challenges.</p>
        
                <h2>Explore Geometric Principles</h2>
                <p>Geometric architecture goes beyond triangles, squares, and circles. It dives into fractals, tessellations, and hyperbolic designs, creating breathtaking spaces that defy convention. From ancient temples to futuristic cities, geometry continues to shape our world.</p>
